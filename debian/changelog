open-isns (0.96-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/tests: refactor code, show isnsd status if auth test fails
  * Rename libisns0-udeb to libisns-nocrypto0-udeb.
    The udeb only contains the library required for future open-iscsi
    versions (there is no need to run an iSNS server in a d-i
    environment), which is the variant that's not linked against OpenSSL
    to be compatible with the GPL. In contrast to libisns0, which
    contains both versions of the library (including the OpenSSL-linked
    libisns.so.0), the package name of the udeb should reflect the name
    of the library included.

open-isns (0.96-3) unstable; urgency=medium
